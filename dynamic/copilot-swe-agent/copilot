### Solution Pathway for Failing Job

The failure in the workflow arises due to the presence of the special token `<|endoftext|>` in the processed text, which is explicitly forbidden by the encoding logic. Additionally, the retry mechanism for starting MCP servers is exhausted, terminating after the maximum retry limit.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

#### 1. Address the Forbidden Token Issue
The encoding logic in the script throws an error whenever forbidden tokens like `<|endoftext|>` are detected. Modify the script to handle these tokens gracefully instead of abruptly terminating. Here's a suggested implementation:

```javascript
function encode(text) {
  const forbiddenTokens = ['<|endoftext|>'];
  forbiddenTokens.forEach(token => {
    if (text.includes(token)) {
      console.warn(`Warning: The text contains a special token: ${token}`);
      text = text.replace(new RegExp(token, 'g'), ''); // Remove or replace the forbidden token
    }
  });
  return text;
}
```

- **Explanation**: This modification replaces forbidden tokens or removes them entirely to prevent encoding errors.

#### 2. Enhance MCP Server Retry Logic
The retry logic needs to include adaptive feedback mechanisms to improve server startup success rates. Here's an updated retry script:

```bash
MAX_RETRIES=5
RETRY_COUNT=0
while [ $RETRY_COUNT -lt $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
  echo "Attempting to start MCP server (Attempt $((RETRY_COUNT + 1))/$MAX_RETRIES)"
  if start_mcp_server; then
    echo "MCP server started successfully."
    break
  else
    echo "Failed to start MCP server. Retrying..."
    sleep $((RETRY_COUNT * 2)) # Adds an incremental backoff delay
    RETRY_COUNT=$((RETRY_COUNT + 1))
  fi
done

if [ $RETRY_COUNT -eq $MAX_RETRIES ]; then
  echo "Failed to start MCP servers after $MAX_RETRIES attempts"
  exit 1
fi
```

- **Explanation**: This script introduces an incremental backoff delay, giving the server more time between retries to resolve transient issues.

#### 3. Update Attention Allocation Framework
In the neural-symbolic integration layer, ensure adaptive attention mechanisms are enabled to enhance cognitive synergy.

```python
def configure_attention(model):
    try:
        model.config['attention'] = 'adaptive'  # Enable adaptive attention allocation
        return model
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error loading checkpoint: {e}")
        raise
```

- **Explanation**: Adaptive attention allocation optimizes the model's resource allocation during execution.

### Workflow File Update
Ensure the workflow file `dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot` includes these changes to mitigate similar failures in future runs. Include checks for forbidden tokens before invoking the encoding logic and implement robust retry mechanisms.

### Next Steps
1. Update the relevant files using the suggested code snippets.
2. Test the workflow with simulated inputs containing `<|endoftext|>` to verify stability.
3. Monitor MCP server startup under varying network conditions to validate retry mechanism improvements.
